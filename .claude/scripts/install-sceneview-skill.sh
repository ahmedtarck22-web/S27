#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-sceneview-skill.sh — copies the SceneView agent skill into the
# Android CLI skill registry so `android skills list` exposes it to AI agents.
#
# Usage:
#   bash .claude/scripts/install-sceneview-skill.sh           # install (copy)
#   bash .claude/scripts/install-sceneview-skill.sh --uninstall
#
# After install, run `android skills list` to verify `sceneview` appears under
# the `xr` category. The android CLI v0.7 does NOT follow symlinks in the skills
# directory, so this script always copies. Re-run after pulling new commits
# from the repo to refresh the installed skill.
